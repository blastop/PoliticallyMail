The images can be modified in the following folders:

(NOTE: It's better the names to remain as they are)

./PoliticallyMail/img/\*/\*.*

./PoliticallyMail/img/\*.*

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS :



In order to upload the extension to Google's webstore the ./PoliticallyMail/Files/PoliticallyMail should be

compressed to a ZIP file and uploaded, just like when developing, that same folder should be used as

the "Unpacked Extension".
